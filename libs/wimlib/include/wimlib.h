/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * This is the documentation for the library interface of wimlib 1.13.6, a C
 * library for creating, modifying, extracting, and mounting files in the
 * Windows Imaging (WIM) format.  This documentation is intended for developers
 * only.  If you have installed wimlib and want to know how to use the @b
 * wimlib-imagex program, please see the manual pages and also the <a
 * href="https://wimlib.net/git/?p=wimlib;a=blob;f=README">README file</a>.
 *
 * @section sec_installing Installing
 *
 * @subsection UNIX
 *
 * Download the source code from https://wimlib.net.  Install the library by
 * running <c>configure && make && sudo make install</c>.  See the README for
 * information about configuration options.  To use wimlib in your program after
 * installing it, include wimlib.h and link your program with <c>-lwim</c>.
 *
 * @subsection Windows
 *
 * Download the Windows binary distribution with the appropriate architecture
 * (i686 or x86_64 --- also called "x86" and "amd64" respectively) from
 * https://wimlib.net.  Link your program with libwim-15.dll.  If needed by your
 * programming language or development environment, the import library
 * libwim.lib and C/C++ header wimlib.h can be found in the directory "devel" in
 * the ZIP file.
 *
 * If you need to access the DLL from non-C/C++ programming languages, note that
 * the calling convention is "cdecl".
 *
 * If you want to build wimlib from source on Windows, see README.WINDOWS.  This
 * is only needed if you are making modifications to wimlib.
 *
 * @section sec_examples Examples
 *
 * Several examples are located in the "examples" directory of the source
 * distribution.  Also see @ref sec_basic_wim_handling_concepts below.
 *
 * There is also the <a
 * href="https://wimlib.net/git/?p=wimlib;a=blob;f=programs/imagex.c">
 * source code of <b>wimlib-imagex</b></a>, which is complicated but uses most
 * capabilities of wimlib.
 *
 * @section backward_compatibility Backward Compatibility
 *
 * New releases of wimlib are intended to be backward compatible with old
 * releases, except when the libtool "age" is reset.  This most recently
 * occurred for the v1.7.0 (libwim15) release (June 2014).  Since the library is
 * becoming increasingly stable, the goal is to maintain the current API/ABI for
 * as long as possible unless there is a strong reason not to.
 *
 * As with any other library, applications should not rely on internal
 * implementation details that may be subject to change.
 *
 * @section sec_basic_wim_handling_concepts Basic WIM handling concepts
 *
 * wimlib wraps up a WIM file in an opaque ::WIMStruct structure.   There are
 * two ways to create such a structure:
 *
 * 1. wimlib_open_wim() opens an on-disk WIM file and creates a ::WIMStruct for
 *    it.
 * 2. wimlib_create_new_wim() creates a new ::WIMStruct that initially contains
 *    no images and does not yet have a backing on-disk file.
 *
 * A ::WIMStruct contains zero or more independent directory trees called @a
 * images.  Images may be extracted, added, deleted, exported, and updated using
 * various API functions.  (See @ref G_extracting_wims and @ref G_modifying_wims
 * for more details.)
 *
 * Changes made to a WIM represented by a ::WIMStruct have no persistent effect
 * until the WIM is actually written to an on-disk file.  This can be done using
 * wimlib_write(), but if the WIM was originally opened using wimlib_open_wim(),
 * then wimlib_overwrite() can be used instead.  (See @ref
 * G_writing_and_overwriting_wims for more details.)
 *
 * wimlib's API is designed to let you combine functions to accomplish tasks in
 * a flexible way.  Here are some example sequences of function calls:
 *
 * Apply an image from a WIM file, similar to the command-line program
 * <b>wimapply</b>:
 *
 * 1. wimlib_open_wim()
 * 2. wimlib_extract_image()
 *
 * Capture an image into a new WIM file, similar to <b>wimcapture</b>:
 *
 * 1. wimlib_create_new_wim()
 * 2. wimlib_add_image()
 * 3. wimlib_write()
 *
 * Append an image to an existing WIM file, similar to <b>wimappend</b>:
 *
 * 1. wimlib_open_wim()
 * 2. wimlib_add_image()
 * 3. wimlib_overwrite()
 *
 * Delete an image from an existing WIM file, similar to <b>wimdelete</b>:
 *
 * 1. wimlib_open_wim()
 * 2. wimlib_delete_image()
 * 3. wimlib_overwrite()
 *
 * Export an image from one WIM file to another, similar to <b>wimexport</b>:
 *
 * 1. wimlib_open_wim() (on source)
 * 2. wimlib_open_wim() (on destination)
 * 3. wimlib_export_image()
 * 4. wimlib_overwrite() (on destination)
 *
 * The API also lets you do things the command-line tools don't directly allow.
 * For example, you could make multiple changes to a WIM before efficiently
 * committing the changes with just one call to wimlib_overwrite().  Perhaps you
 * want to both delete an image and add a new one; or perhaps you want to
 * customize an image with wimlib_update_image() after adding it.  All these use
 * cases are supported by the API.
 *
 * @section sec_cleaning_up Cleaning up
 *
 * After you are done with any ::WIMStruct, you can call wimlib_free() to free
 * all resources associated with it.  Also, when you are completely done with
 * using wimlib in your program, you can call wimlib_global_cleanup() to free
 * any other resources allocated by the library.
 *
 * @section sec_error_handling Error Handling
 *
 * Most functions in wimlib return 0 on success and a positive
 * ::wimlib_error_code value on failure.  Use wimlib_get_error_string() to get a
 * string that describes an error code.  wimlib also can print error messages to
 * standard error or a custom file when an error occurs, and these may be more
 * informative than the error code; to enable this, call
 * wimlib_set_print_errors().  Please note that this is for convenience only,
 * and some errors can occur without a message being printed.  Currently, error
 * messages and strings (as well as all documentation, for that matter) are only
 * available in English.
 *
 * @section sec_encodings Character encoding
 *
 * To support Windows as well as UNIX-like systems, wimlib's API typically takes
 * and returns strings of ::wimlib_tchar which have a platform-dependent type
 * and encoding.
 *
 * On Windows, each ::wimlib_tchar is a 2-byte <tt>wchar_t</tt>.  The encoding
 * is meant to be UTF-16LE.  However, unpaired surrogates are permitted because
 * neither Windows nor the NTFS filesystem forbids them in filenames.
 *
 * On UNIX-like systems, each ::wimlib_tchar is a 1 byte <tt>char</tt>.  The
 * encoding is meant to be UTF-8.  However, for compatibility with Windows-style
 * filenames that are not valid UTF-16LE, surrogate codepoints are permitted.
 * Other multibyte encodings (e.g. ISO-8859-1) or garbage sequences of bytes are
 * not permitted.
 *
 * @section sec_advanced Additional information and features
 *
 *
 * @subsection subsec_mounting_wim_images Mounting WIM images
 *
 * See @ref G_mounting_wim_images.
 *
 * @subsection subsec_progress_functions Progress Messages
 *
 * See @ref G_progress.
 *
 * @subsection subsec_non_standalone_wims Non-standalone WIMs
 *
 * See @ref G_nonstandalone_wims.
 *
 * @subsection subsec_pipable_wims Pipable WIMs
 *
 * wimlib supports a special "pipable" WIM format which unfortunately is @b not
 * compatible with Microsoft's software.  To create a pipable WIM, call
 * wimlib_write(), wimlib_write_to_fd(), or wimlib_overwrite() with
 * ::WIMLIB_WRITE_FLAG_PIPABLE specified.  Pipable WIMs are pipable in both
 * directions, so wimlib_write_to_fd() can be used to write a pipable WIM to a
 * pipe, and wimlib_extract_image_from_pipe() can be used to apply an image from
 * a pipable WIM.  wimlib can also transparently open and operate on pipable WIM
 * s using a seekable file descriptor using the regular function calls (e.g.
 * wimlib_open_wim(), wimlib_extract_image()).
 *
 * See the documentation for the <b>--pipable</b> flag of <b>wimcapture</b> for
 * more information about pipable WIMs.
 *
 * @subsection subsec_thread_safety Thread Safety
 *
 * A ::WIMStruct is not thread-safe and cannot be accessed by multiple threads
 * concurrently, even for "read-only" operations such as extraction.  However,
 * users are free to use <i>different</i> ::WIMStruct's from different threads
 * concurrently.  It is even allowed for multiple ::WIMStruct's to be backed by
 * the same on-disk WIM file, although "overwrites" should never be done in such
 * a scenario.
 *
 * In addition, several functions change global state and should only be called
 * when a single thread is active in the library.  These functions are:
 *
 * - wimlib_global_init()
 * - wimlib_global_cleanup()
 * - wimlib_set_memory_allocator()
 * - wimlib_set_print_errors()
 * - wimlib_set_error_file()
 * - wimlib_set_error_file_by_name()
 *
 * @subsection subsec_limitations Limitations
 *
 * This section documents some technical limitations of wimlib not already
 * described in the documentation for @b wimlib-imagex.
 *
 * - The old WIM format from Vista pre-releases is not supported.
 * - wimlib does not provide a clone of the @b PEImg tool, or the @b DISM
 *   functionality other than that already present in @b ImageX, that allows you
 *   to make certain Windows-specific modifications to a Windows PE image, such
 *   as adding a driver or Windows component.  Such a tool could be implemented
 *   on top of wimlib.
 *
 * @subsection more_info More information
 *
 * You are advised to read the README as well as the documentation for
 * <b>wimlib-imagex</b>, since not all relevant information is repeated here in
 * the API documentation.

 * ::WIMStruct to an on-disk file.
 *
 * @section sec_adding_images Capturing and adding WIM images
 *
 * As described in @ref sec_basic_wim_handling_concepts, capturing a new WIM or
 * appending an image to an existing WIM is a multi-step process, but at its
 * core is wimlib_add_image() or an equivalent function.  Normally,
 * wimlib_add_image() takes an on-disk directory tree and logically adds it to a
 * ::WIMStruct as a new image.  However, when supported by the build of the
 * library, there is also a special NTFS volume capture mode (entered when
 * ::WIMLIB_ADD_FLAG_NTFS is specified) that allows adding the image directly
 * from an unmounted NTFS volume.
 *
 * Another function, wimlib_add_image_multisource() is also provided.  It
 * generalizes wimlib_add_image() to allow combining multiple files or directory
 * trees into a single WIM image in a configurable way.
 *
 * For maximum customization of WIM image creation, it is also possible to add a
 * completely empty WIM image with wimlib_add_empty_image(), then update it with
 * wimlib_update_image().  (This is in fact what wimlib_add_image() and
 * wimlib_add_image_multisource() do internally.)
 *
 * Note that some details of how image addition/capture works are documented
 * more fully in the documentation for <b>wimcapture</b>.
 *
 * @section sec_deleting_images Deleting WIM images
 *
 * wimlib_delete_image() can delete an image from a ::WIMStruct.  But as usual,
 * wimlib_write() or wimlib_overwrite() must be called to cause the changes to
 * be made persistent in an on-disk WIM file.
 *
 * @section sec_exporting_images Exporting WIM images
 *
 * wimlib_export_image() can copy, or "export", an image from one WIM to
 * another.
 *
 * @section sec_other_modifications Other modifications
 *
 * wimlib_update_image() can add, delete, and rename files in a WIM image.
 *
 * wimlib_set_image_property() can change other image metadata.
 *
 * wimlib_set_wim_info() can change information about the WIM file itself, such
 * as the boot index.
 */

/** @defgroup G_extracting_wims Extracting WIMs
 *
 * @brief Extract files, directories, and images from a WIM.
 *
 * wimlib_extract_image() extracts, or "applies", an image from a WIM,
 * represented by a ::WIMStruct.  This normally extracts the image to a
 * directory, but when supported by the build of the library there is also a
 * special NTFS volume extraction mode (entered when ::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_NTFS
 * is specified) that allows extracting a WIM image directly to an unmounted
 * NTFS volume.  Various other flags allow further customization of image
 * extraction.
 *
 * wimlib_extract_paths() and wimlib_extract_pathlist() allow extracting a list
 * of (possibly wildcard) paths from a WIM image.
 *
 * wimlib_extract_image_from_pipe() extracts an image from a pipable WIM sent
 * over a pipe; see @ref subsec_pipable_wims.
 *
 * Some details of how WIM extraction works are described more fully in the
 * documentation for <b>wimapply</b> and <b>wimextract</b>.
 */

/** @defgroup G_mounting_wim_images Mounting WIM images
 *
 * @brief Mount and unmount WIM images.
 *
 * On Linux, wimlib supports mounting images from WIM files either read-only or
 * read-write.  To mount an image, call wimlib_mount_image().  To unmount an
 * image, call wimlib_unmount_image().  Mounting can be done without root
 * privileges because it is implemented using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).
 *
 * If wimlib is compiled using the <c>--without-fuse</c> flag, these functions
 * will be available but will fail with ::WIMLIB_ERR_UNSUPPORTED.
 *
 * Note: if mounting is unsupported, wimlib still provides another way to modify
 * a WIM image (wimlib_update_image()).
 */

/**
 * @defgroup G_progress Progress Messages
 *
 * @brief Track the progress of long WIM operations.
 *
 * Library users can provide a progress function which will be called
 * periodically during operations such as extracting a WIM image or writing a
 * WIM image.  A ::WIMStruct can have a progress function of type
 * ::wimlib_progress_func_t associated with it by calling
 * wimlib_register_progress_function() or by opening the ::WIMStruct using
 * wimlib_open_wim_with_progress().  Once this is done, the progress function
 * will be called automatically during many operations, such as
 * wimlib_extract_image() and wimlib_write().
 *
 * Some functions that do not operate directly on a user-provided ::WIMStruct,
 * such as wimlib_join(), also take the progress function directly using an
 * extended version of the function, such as wimlib_join_with_progress().
 *
 * Since wimlib v1.7.0, progress functions are no longer just unidirectional.
 * You can now return ::WIMLIB_PROGRESS_STATUS_ABORT to cause the current
 * operation to be aborted.  wimlib v1.7.0 also added the third argument to
 * ::wimlib_progress_func_t, which is a user-supplied context.
 */

/** @defgroup G_writing_and_overwriting_wims Writing and Overwriting WIMs
 *
 * @brief Create or update an on-disk WIM file.
 *
 * wimlib_write() creates a new on-disk WIM file, whereas wimlib_overwrite()
 * updates an existing WIM file.  See @ref sec_basic_wim_handling_concepts for
 * more information about the API design.
 */

/** @defgroup G_nonstandalone_wims Creating and handling non-standalone WIMs
 *
 * @brief Create and handle non-standalone WIMs, such as split and delta WIMs.
 *
 * A ::WIMStruct backed by an on-disk file normally represents a fully
 * standalone WIM archive.  However, WIM archives can also be arranged in
 * non-standalone ways, such as a set of on-disk files that together form a
 * single "split WIM" or "delta WIM".  Such arrangements are fully supported by
 * wimlib.  However, as a result, in such cases a ::WIMStruct created from one
 * of these on-disk files initially only partially represents the full WIM and
 * needs to, in effect, be logically combined with other ::WIMStruct's before
 * performing certain operations, such as extracting files with
 * wimlib_extract_image() or wimlib_extract_paths().  This is done by calling
 * wimlib_reference_resource_files() or wimlib_reference_resources().  Note: if
 * you fail to do so, you may see the error code
 * ::WIMLIB_ERR_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND; this just indicates that data is not
 * available because the appropriate WIM files have not yet been referenced.
 *
 * wimlib_write() can create delta WIMs as well as standalone WIMs, but a
 * specialized function (wimlib_split()) is needed to create a split WIM.

 *       the "offset" is actually the offset in the uncompressed solid resource
 *       rather than the offset from the beginning of the WIM file.
 *
 *    C. If the blob is *not* located in any type of WIM resource, for example
 *       if it's in a external file that was scanned by wimlib_add_image(), then
 *       we usually won't know any more information.  The sha1_hash might be

 * The exact behavior of how wimlib extracts files from a WIM image is
 * controllable by the @p extract_flags parameter, but there also are
 * differences depending on the platform (UNIX-like vs Windows).  See the
 * documentation for <b>wimapply</b> for more information, including about the
 * NTFS-3G extraction mode.
 *
 * @param wim
 *	The WIM from which to extract the image(s), specified as a pointer to the
 *	::WIMStruct for a standalone WIM file, a delta WIM file, or part 1 of a
 *	split WIM.  In the case of a WIM file that is not standalone, this
 *	::WIMStruct must have had any needed external resources previously
 *	referenced using wimlib_reference_resources() or
 *	wimlib_reference_resource_files().
 * @param image
 *	The 1-based index of the image to extract, or ::WIMLIB_ALL_IMAGES to
 *	extract all images.  Note: ::WIMLIB_ALL_IMAGES is unsupported in NTFS-3G
 *	extraction mode.
 * @param target
 *	A null-terminated string which names the location to which the image(s)
 *	will be extracted.  By default, this is interpreted as a path to a
 *	directory.  Alternatively, if ::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_NTFS is specified in
 *	@p extract_flags, then this is interpreted as a path to an unmounted
 *	NTFS volume.
 * @param extract_flags
 *	Bitwise OR of flags prefixed with WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG.
 *
 * @return 0 on success; a ::wimlib_error_code value on failure.

 *	The metadata for an image to extract was invalid.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_INVALID_PARAM
 *	The extraction flags were invalid; more details may be found in the

 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_INVALID_RESOURCE_HASH
 *	The data of a file that needed to be extracted was corrupt.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_LINK
 *	Failed to create a symbolic link or a hard link.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_METADATA_NOT_FOUND
 *	@p wim does not contain image metadata; for example, it represents a
 *	non-first part of a split WIM.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_MKDIR
 *	Failed create a directory.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_NTFS_3G
 *	libntfs-3g reported that a problem occurred while writing to the NTFS
 *	volume.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_OPEN
 *	Could not create a file, or failed to open an already-extracted file.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_READ
 *	Failed to read data from the WIM.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_READLINK
 *	Failed to determine the target of a symbolic link in the WIM.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_REPARSE_POINT_FIXUP_FAILED
 *	Failed to fix the target of an absolute symbolic link (e.g. if the
 *	target would have exceeded the maximum allowed length).  (Only if
 *	reparse data was supported by the extraction mode and
 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_STRICT_SYMLINKS was specified in @p
 *	extract_flags.)
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND

 *	Failed to set the short name of a file.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_SET_TIMESTAMPS
 *	Failed to set timestamps on a file.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_UNEXPECTED_END_OF_FILE
 *	Unexpected end-of-file occurred when reading data from the WIM.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_UNSUPPORTED
 *	A requested extraction flag, or the data or metadata that must be
 *	extracted to support it, is unsupported in the build and configuration
 *	of wimlib, or on the current platform or extraction mode or target
 *	volume.  Flags affected by this include ::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_NTFS,

 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_STRICT_SHORT_NAMES,
 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_STRICT_TIMESTAMPS, and
 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_STRICT_SYMLINKS.  For example, if
 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_STRICT_SHORT_NAMES is specified in @p
 *	extract_flags, ::WIMLIB_ERR_UNSUPPORTED will be returned if the WIM
 *	image contains one or more files with short names, but extracting short
 *	names is not supported --- on Windows, this occurs if the target volume
 *	does not support short names, while on non-Windows, this occurs if
 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_NTFS was not specified in @p extract_flags.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_WIMBOOT
 *	::WIMLIB_EXTRACT_FLAG_WIMBOOT was specified in @p extract_flags, but
 *	there was a problem creating WIMBoot pointer files or registering a

 *	worthwhile for your application.
 *	<br/>
 *	The compression level does not affect the format of the compressed data.
 *	Therefore, it is a compressor-only parameter and does not need to be
 *	passed to the decompressor.
 *	<br/>
 *	Since wimlib v1.8.0, this parameter can be OR-ed with the flag
 *	::WIMLIB_COMPRESSOR_FLAG_DESTRUCTIVE.  This creates the compressor in a
 *	mode where it is allowed to modify the input buffer.  Specifically, in
 *	this mode, if compression succeeds, the input buffer may have been
 *	modified, whereas if compression does not succeed the input buffer still
 *	may have been written to but will have been restored exactly to its
 *	original state.  This mode is designed to save some memory when using
 *	large buffer sizes.
 * @param compressor_ret
 *	A location into which to return the pointer to the allocated compressor.
 *	The allocated compressor can be used for any number of calls to
 *	wimlib_compress() before being freed with wimlib_free_compressor().
 *
 * @return 0 on success; a ::wimlib_error_code value on failure.
 *
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_INVALID_COMPRESSION_TYPE
 *	@p ctype was not a supported compression type.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_INVALID_PARAM
 *	@p max_block_size was invalid for the compression type, or @p
 *	compressor_ret was @c NULL.
 * @retval ::WIMLIB_ERR_NOMEM
 *	Insufficient memory to allocate the compressor.
