/*
 * This is a decompressor for the LZMS compression format used by Microsoft.
 * This format is not documented, but it is one of the formats supported by the
 * compression API available in Windows 8, and as of Windows 8 it is one of the
 * formats that can be used in WIM files.
 *
 * This decompressor only implements "raw" decompression, which decompresses a
 * single LZMS-compressed block.  This behavior is the same as that of
 * Decompress() in the Windows 8 compression API when using a compression handle
 * created with CreateDecompressor() with the Algorithm parameter specified as
 * COMPRESS_ALGORITHM_LZMS | COMPRESS_RAW.  Presumably, non-raw LZMS data is a
 * container format from which the locations and sizes (both compressed and
 * uncompressed) of the constituent blocks can be determined.
 *
 * An LZMS-compressed block must be read in 16-bit little endian units from both
 * directions.  One logical bitstream starts at the front of the block and
 * proceeds forwards.  Another logical bitstream starts at the end of the block
 * and proceeds backwards.  Bits read from the forwards bitstream constitute
 * binary range-encoded data, whereas bits read from the backwards bitstream
 * constitute Huffman-encoded symbols or verbatim bits.  For both bitstreams,
 * the ordering of the bits within the 16-bit coding units is such that the
 * first bit is the high-order bit and the last bit is the low-order bit.
 *
 * From these two logical bitstreams, an LZMS decompressor can reconstitute the
 * series of items that make up the LZMS data representation.  Each such item
 * may be a literal byte or a match.  Matches may be either traditional LZ77
 * matches or "delta" matches, either of which can have its offset encoded
 * explicitly or encoded via a reference to a recently used (repeat) offset.
 *
 * A traditional LZ77 match consists of a length and offset.  It asserts that
 * the sequence of bytes beginning at the current position and extending for the
 * length is equal to the same-length sequence of bytes at the offset back in
 * the data buffer.  This type of match can be visualized as follows, with the
 * caveat that the sequences may overlap:
 *
 *                                offset
 *                         --------------------
 *                         |                  |
 *                         B[1...len]         A[1...len]
 *
 * Decoding proceeds as follows:
 *
 *                      do {
 *                              *A++ = *B++;
 *                      } while (--length);
 *
 * On the other hand, a delta match consists of a "span" as well as a length and
 * offset.  A delta match can be visualized as follows, with the caveat that the
 * various sequences may overlap:
 *
 *                                       offset
 *                            -----------------------------
 *                            |                           |
 *                    span    |                   span    |
 *                -------------               -------------
 *                |           |               |           |
 *                D[1...len]  C[1...len]      B[1...len]  A[1...len]
 *
 * Decoding proceeds as follows:
 *
 *                      do {
 *                              *A++ = *B++ + *C++ - *D++;
 *                      } while (--length);
 *
 * A delta match asserts that the bytewise differences of the A and B sequences
 * are equal to the bytewise differences of the C and D sequences.  The
 * sequences within each pair are separated by the same number of bytes, the
 * "span".  The inter-pair distance is the "offset".  In LZMS, spans are
 * restricted to powers of 2 between 2**0 and 2**7 inclusively.  Offsets are
 * restricted to multiples of the span.  The stored value for the offset is the
 * "raw offset", which is the real offset divided by the span.
 *
 * Delta matches can cover data containing a series of power-of-2 sized integers
 * that is linearly increasing or decreasing.  Another way of thinking about it
 * is that a delta match can match a longer sequence that is interrupted by a
 * non-matching byte, provided that the non-matching byte is a continuation of a
 * linearly changing pattern.  Examples of files that may contain data like this
 * are uncompressed bitmap images, uncompressed digital audio, and Unicode data
 * tables.  To some extent, this match type is a replacement for delta filters
 * or multimedia filters that are sometimes used in other compression software
 * (e.g.  'xz --delta --lzma2').  However, on most types of files, delta matches
 * do not seem to be very useful.
 *
 * Both LZ and delta matches may use overlapping sequences.  Therefore, they
 * must be decoded as if only one byte is copied at a time.
 *
 * For both LZ and delta matches, any match length in [1, 1073809578] can be
 * represented.  Similarly, any match offset in [1, 1180427428] can be
 * represented.  For delta matches, this range applies to the raw offset, so the
 * real offset may be larger.
 *
 * For LZ matches, up to 3 repeat offsets are allowed, similar to some other
 * LZ-based formats such as LZX and LZMA.  They must updated in an LRU fashion,
 * except for a quirk: inserting anything to the front of the queue must be
 * delayed by one LZMS item.  The reason for this is presumably that there is
 * almost no reason to code the same match offset twice in a row, since you
 * might as well have coded a longer match at that offset.  For this same
 * reason, it also is a requirement that when an offset in the queue is used,
 * that offset is removed from the queue immediately (and made pending for
 * front-insertion after the following decoded item), and everything to the
 * right is shifted left one queue slot.  This creates a need for an "overflow"
 * fourth entry in the queue, even though it is only possible to decode
 * references to the first 3 entries at any given time.  The queue must be
 * initialized to the offsets {1, 2, 3, 4}.
 *
 * Repeat delta matches are handled similarly, but for them the queue contains
 * (power, raw offset) pairs.  This queue must be initialized to
 * {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)}.
 *
 * Bits from the binary range decoder must be used to disambiguate item types.
 * The range decoder must hold two state variables: the range, which must
 * initially be set to 0xffffffff, and the current code, which must initially be
 * set to the first 32 bits read from the forwards bitstream.  The range must be
 * maintained above 0xffff; when it falls below 0xffff, both the range and code
 * must be left-shifted by 16 bits and the low 16 bits of the code must be
 * filled in with the next 16 bits from the forwards bitstream.
 *
 * To decode each bit, the binary range decoder requires a probability that is
 * logically a real number between 0 and 1.  Multiplying this probability by the
 * current range and taking the floor gives the bound between the 0-bit region of
 * the range and the 1-bit region of the range.  However, in LZMS, probabilities
 * are restricted to values of n/64 where n is an integer is between 1 and 63
 * inclusively, so the implementation may use integer operations instead.
 * Following calculation of the bound, if the current code is in the 0-bit
 * region, the new range becomes the current code and the decoded bit is 0;
 * otherwise, the bound must be subtracted from both the range and the code, and
 * the decoded bit is 1.  More information about range coding can be found at
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_encoding.  Furthermore, note that the
 * LZMA format also uses range coding and has public domain code available for
 * it.
 *
 * The probability used to range-decode each bit must be taken from a table, of
 * which one instance must exist for each distinct context, or "binary decision
 * class", in which a range-decoded bit is needed.  At each call of the range
 * decoder, the appropriate probability must be obtained by indexing the
 * appropriate probability table with the last 4 (in the context disambiguating
 * literals from matches), 5 (in the context disambiguating LZ matches from
 * delta matches), or 6 (in all other contexts) bits recently range-decoded in
 * that context, ordered such that the most recently decoded bit is the
 * low-order bit of the index.
 *
 * Furthermore, each probability entry itself is variable, as its value must be
 * maintained as n/64 where n is the number of 0 bits in the most recently
 * decoded 64 bits with that same entry.  This allows the compressed
 * representation to adapt to the input and use fewer bits to represent the most
 * likely data; note that LZMA uses a similar scheme.  Initially, the most
 * recently 64 decoded bits for each probability entry are assumed to be
 * 0x0000000055555555 (high order to low order); therefore, all probabilities
 * are initially 48/64.  During the course of decoding, each probability may be
 * updated to as low as 0/64 (as a result of reading many consecutive 1 bits
 * with that entry) or as high as 64/64 (as a result of reading many consecutive
 * 0 bits with that entry); however, probabilities of 0/64 and 64/64 cannot be
 * used as-is but rather must be adjusted to 1/64 and 63/64, respectively,
 * before being used for range decoding.
 *
 * Representations of the LZMS items themselves must be read from the backwards
 * bitstream.  For this, there are 5 different Huffman codes used:
 *
 *  - The literal code, used for decoding literal bytes.  Each of the 256
 *    symbols represents a literal byte.  This code must be rebuilt whenever
 *    1024 symbols have been decoded with it.
 *
 *  - The LZ offset code, used for decoding the offsets of standard LZ77
 *    matches.  Each symbol represents an offset slot, which corresponds to a
 *    base value and some number of extra bits which must be read and added to
 *    the base value to reconstitute the full offset.  The number of symbols in
 *    this code is the number of offset slots needed to represent all possible
 *    offsets in the uncompressed block.  This code must be rebuilt whenever
 *    1024 symbols have been decoded with it.
 *
 *  - The length code, used for decoding length symbols.  Each of the 54 symbols
 *    represents a length slot, which corresponds to a base value and some
 *    number of extra bits which must be read and added to the base value to
 *    reconstitute the full length.  This code must be rebuilt whenever 512
 *    symbols have been decoded with it.
 *
 *  - The delta offset code, used for decoding the raw offsets of delta matches.
 *    Each symbol corresponds to an offset slot, which corresponds to a base
 *    value and some number of extra bits which must be read and added to the
 *    base value to reconstitute the full raw offset.  The number of symbols in
 *    this code is equal to the number of symbols in the LZ offset code.  This
 *    code must be rebuilt whenever 1024 symbols have been decoded with it.
 *
 *  - The delta power code, used for decoding the powers of delta matches.  Each
 *    of the 8 symbols corresponds to a power.  This code must be rebuilt
 *    whenever 512 symbols have been decoded with it.
 *
 * Initially, each Huffman code must be built assuming that each symbol in that
 * code has frequency 1.  Following that, each code must be rebuilt each time a
 * certain number of symbols, as noted above, has been decoded with it.  The
 * symbol frequencies for a code must be halved after each rebuild of that code;
 * this makes the codes adapt to the more recent data.
 *
 * Like other compression formats such as XPRESS, LZX, and DEFLATE, the LZMS
 * format requires that all Huffman codes be constructed in canonical form.
 * This form requires that same-length codewords be lexicographically ordered
 * the same way as the corresponding symbols and that all shorter codewords
 * lexicographically precede longer codewords.  Such a code can be constructed
 * directly from codeword lengths.
 *
 * Even with the canonical code restriction, the same frequencies can be used to
 * construct multiple valid Huffman codes.  Therefore, the decompressor needs to
 * construct the right one.  Specifically, the LZMS format requires that the
 * Huffman code be constructed as if the well-known priority queue algorithm is
 * used and frequency ties are always broken in favor of leaf nodes.
 *
 * Codewords in LZMS are guaranteed to not exceed 15 bits.  The format otherwise
 * places no restrictions on codeword length.  Therefore, the Huffman code
 * construction algorithm that a correct LZMS decompressor uses need not
 * implement length-limited code construction.  But if it does (e.g. by virtue
 * of being shared among multiple compression algorithms), the details of how it
 * does so are unimportant, provided that the maximum codeword length parameter
 * is set to at least 15 bits.
 *
 * After all LZMS items have been decoded, the data must be postprocessed to
 * translate absolute address encoded in x86 instructions into their original
 * relative addresses.
 *
 * Details omitted above can be found in the code.  Note that in the absence of
 * an official specification there is no guarantee that this decompressor
 * handles all possible cases.
